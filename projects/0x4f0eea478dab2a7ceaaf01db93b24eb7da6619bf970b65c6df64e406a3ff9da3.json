  "impactDescription": "I really like the L2 network especially the fees are very cheap compared to L1 or the original (Ethereum). Impact is profit. Profit is an essential factor for the survival & growth of any business including crypto. Price, quantity, variable & fixed costs are the main factors that go into determining profit.",
  "contributionDescription": "Just want to make a profit from NFTs without any prior knowledge of Airdrop OP. I am very happy to hear & receive this news after getting what I got. However, after several months the Airdrop OP results were stolen by irresponsible hackers & I only swapped 1 OP, There are still several OP tokens left that have been taken by the hacker. I really regret not swapping it at that time.",
