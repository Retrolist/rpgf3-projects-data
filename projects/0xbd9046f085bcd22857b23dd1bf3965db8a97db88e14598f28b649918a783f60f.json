  "impactDescription": "Over the last 2 years, Socket has worked to eliminate one of the biggest problems hindering user onboarding and protocol adoption on Optimism. Along with our 100+ ecosystem, we powered seamless cross-chain experiences right within apps, removing any friction to try Optimism.\nHere is our impact so far:\n- Bridged $1B+ volume in 2 years across Metamask, Zapper, Zerion, Slingshot, Bungee, Layer3 & 30+ apps\n- Onboarded 1.5M+ wallets with a simplified 1-click onboarding into Optimism on top OP native apps including Synthetix, Kwenta, Lyra & Polynomial\n- Facilitated 600K+ gas top-ups to Optimism via our public good Refuel\n- Facilitated 125K+ transfers to Base & Zora supercharging OP-Stack growth\n- SuperBridge to Aevo facilitated 10K+ zero-cost transfers, pushing one step closer to Superchain",
  "contributionDescription": "Socket is an interoperability protocol that powers seamless asset & data transfers for apps across blockchains. 70+ wallets & apps including Metamask, Coinbase Wallet, Bungee, Synthetix, Polynomial, Kwenta, Lyra, Rainbow & Zerion leverage Socket for various cross-chain use cases.\nHere are our contributions to Optimism:\n\n- Enabled onboarding to Optimism right within 30+ wallets, not just from Mainnet but 10+ chains.\n- Improved cross-chain UX for 10+ Optimism native apps including top options and perp protocols with our open-source 'Socket Plugin'\n- Refuel, our public good to Optimism enables users to receive gas tokens, with no extra fees\n- Day 0 bridging support across our 100+ ecosystem for OP-Stack chains like Base, Zora, etc.\n- Built OP-Stack with Aevo to bring zero-cost L2<>L2 bridging",
