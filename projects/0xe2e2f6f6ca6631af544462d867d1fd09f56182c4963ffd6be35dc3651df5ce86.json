  "impactDescription": "Since 2022, we have been at the forefront of providing a comprehensive suite of middleware services meticulously integrated into the heart of Optimism's ecosystem. \n\nThese services (Automate, Relay, Web3 Functions) have not only elevated the functionality but have also enriched the user experience for a diverse array of applications. Some of which include Kwenta, Beefy, Synthetic, Abracadabra, Brahma, Connext, r3vl, portals.fi and many more.\n\nIn our pursuit of simplifying blockchain deployment, we also introduced Gelato RaaS empowering developers to effortlessly launch Rollups with just a single click. \n\nFurther, we  allocated OP tokens received as part of a past grant to support and incentivize developers. Some past projects we've funded include Ricochet, Nexter and Blockpeer Finance.",
  "contributionDescription": "At Gelato, we are dedicated to propelling the development and widespread adoption of Optimism.
