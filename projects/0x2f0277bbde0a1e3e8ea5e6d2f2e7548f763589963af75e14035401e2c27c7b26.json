  "impactDescription": "Oct 10th :  Over the last 30 days, The Reservoir has averaged 55 unique visitors daily (see 'Quantitative Impact'.)\nThough this number may appear not much, it is honest work ;-) especially given the niche and the limited influx of new entrants. \n'Optimism Vision: Founders Week' campaign on Twitter received attention, with 1649 impressions and 50 likes\n\nThe Reservoir also received endorsements from three other OP media outlets - The Optimistic Academy, Web3explorer, The Optimism Guide - each of which has linked to The Reservoir, a testament to the quality of our content.\n\nBeyond tangible metrics, the heartwarming feedback from the community also speaks about our impact (see 'Qualitative impact')",
