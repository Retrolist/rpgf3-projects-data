  "impactDescription": "We help projects with our knowledge and expertise in the grants field, free of cost. To this extent, monthly more than 11750 users on the site find grant programs that could benefit their project.\n\nA few of the startups that we have advised have also gained grants from OP. For example Robo labs was one of the projects we referred to apply for OP grants.\n\nThe voluntary nature of the project and no fee involved means we can only dedicate limited resources to our efforts. Hence we never properly documented the number of projects that have secured grants directly or indirectly through help from Web3 Native.\n\nOur accelerator and VC lists provide projects with additional options to get support when grants might not be the best route to get funding.",
