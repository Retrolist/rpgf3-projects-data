  "impactDescription": "When I shared my thoughts on Optimism Collective, I consistently approached it with honesty and genuineness. Just as I often relay the positive aspects of life to my friends, I brought that same enthusiasm to the contents. By focusing on the 'good stuff' that I'm passionate about, I aimed to uplift and inspire others.",
  "contributionDescription": "My contribution has been to be an honest user who tells my friends how I feel about the experience when I use any applications on Optimism. I wrote the contents and texts in either Thai or English. Moreover, I really love the NFT communities on OP: Bored Town, Apetimism, Optichads, etc so that I am a strong holder. ",
