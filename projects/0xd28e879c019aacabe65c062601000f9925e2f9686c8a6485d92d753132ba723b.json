  "impactDescription": "This repository has been used by many projects to run against their smart contracts and detect common vulnerabilities, participating in the global security of the ecosystem. But more importantly, many security researchers have used this codebase to build their own version and vulnerability detectors so it now powers a lot of these automated audit tools.",
  "contributionDescription": "This repository is an open-source solidity code analyzer.\n\nIts goal is to detect common vulnerabilities in smart contracts, leveraging an analysis of the Abstract Syntax Tree generated by the solidity compiler and regexes.\n\nUltimately, it's a tool that smart-contract developers should run on their code prior to auditing or releasing it to improve their security processes.",
