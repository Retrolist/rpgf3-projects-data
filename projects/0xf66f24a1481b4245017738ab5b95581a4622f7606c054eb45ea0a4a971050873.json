  "contributionDescription": "DexKit's contributions aligned with Optimism's mission of creating an accessible and sustainable Ethereum ecosystem. Through DexAppBuilder, we made DApp development accessible with a user-friendly, no-code/low-code environment, thereby contributing to empowering more users and communities to transition to Optimism. Our open-source principles promoted decentralization and inclusivity, aligning with Optimism's values. By integrating DeFi and NFTs via DexAppBuilder, we enhanced Optimism's utility, maintaining Optimism\u2019s vision for cost-effective Ethereum capabilities. We also cultivated partnerships to ensure growth and long-term sustainability. DexKit played a pivotal role in optimizing Optimism's development, expanding its user base, and promoting accessibility and decentralization.",
