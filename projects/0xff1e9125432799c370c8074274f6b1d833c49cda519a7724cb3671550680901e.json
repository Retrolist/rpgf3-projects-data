  "impactDescription": "rotki has left an indelible mark on optimism. By running locally on users machines, it ensures their financial data remains private and secure. By being opensource it provides transparency.\n\nIts unwavering support for optimism began early; it was the first EVM chain integrated after mainnet, boasting broad protocol support. Its decoding system won praise from users, offering more user-friendly transaction visibility than etherscan.\n\nIts PnL reporting aids optimism users in accounting for their activities, helping them make sense of their financials.\n\nIts opensource nature has spurred collaboration within the community. It has given rise to projects like Buchfink and Decodify, which have further enriched the ecosystem by providing plaintext accounting and decoding solutions respectively.",
  "contributionDescription": "Rotki has made significant contributions to Optimism. From early days, rotki recognized the potential of Optimism as an L2 and was the first EVM chain to be integrated\n\nIt supports many Optimism protocols and superchain capabilities making it a versatile and indispensable tool for those navigating the ecosystem\n\nIts innovative decoding system for transactions has greatly enhanced user experience. Optimism users have praised it as a more user-friendly alternative to Etherscan\n\nIt also offers PnL reports, allowing Optimism users to do accounting in a privacy preserving way\n\nIts contributions encompass opensource code, tracking, protocols support, user-friendly decoding system and PnL accounting. These have solidified rotki's role as a vital platform within the Optimistic Ethereum community",
