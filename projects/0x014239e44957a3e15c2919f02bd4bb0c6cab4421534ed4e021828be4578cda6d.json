One of the significant impacts of Optimism that I have been promoting has been its contribution to Ethereum's scalability. I truly believe that Optimism can make Ethereum bigger and better. Also, I have begun to provide more liquidity within the different Optimism protocols. I am part of a Discord group of Web3 enthusiasts and am bringing up Optimism whenever I can.",
