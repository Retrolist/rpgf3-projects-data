  "impactDescription": "Our contributions and projects on the OP Superchain have onboarded both artists and collectors alike into the ecosystem. Additionally, we started releases on ETH Mainnet originally and made a complete transition to OP Stack because we believe this is where creators will flourish. We have been a beacon for other artists switching off of Mainnet.",
  "contributionDescription": "LNRZ was created by artists, for artists. We are a distribution vessel that gets great music heard, and great artists paid.\n\nOver the past 7 months, we\u2019ve been a leading curator of exciting onchain music drops, having partnered with 60+ artists and multiple companies, including OP Collective, Base, and Zora Network.\n\nOur efforts have been successful in bringing visibility to emerging talent and their incredible music.",
