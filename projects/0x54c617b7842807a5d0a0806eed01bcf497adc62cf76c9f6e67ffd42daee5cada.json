  "contributionDescription": "EIP 4337 introduced new abstracts entities called UserOps, Bundler, paymater and factory, which are not understood by the underlying ethereum protocol. \nThus no infrastructure component recognizes these entities unless specifically designed for it.\nJiffyscan is the only tool to let you explore details of a UserOp introduced by ERC-4337, just by giving the UserOp Hash.\nUsers can explore details across 16 different mainnets and testnets.\nThere's a data API available as well to query the details of a given UserOp, currently for free.",
