  "impactDescription": "With the efforts and research we have put in, my team and I have built a large web3 music community in Vietnam. We were able to raise nearly 30 ETH, which may not be a large amount, but it is a great achievement for us considering the web3 music market is still in its early stages and not many people are aware of it or know much about it.",
  "contributionDescription": "I have been following and learning about Optimism (OP) since the early days. I have been involved in building a community for people who share the same passion and belief in Optimism in Vietnam.\n\nWe have been building and supporting the adoption of OP and its applications, such as in music. I am one of the co-founders of the Camel Venture fund, a familiar name within the music community on Sound.xyz.\n\nOn a personal level, I have also been involved in supporting and answering questions from members within and outside the community to help them better understand the platform's workings.\n\nIn the near future, I plan to continue developing additional support for artists in Vietnam so that they can develop and release music products on the Optimism blockchain platform and Sound.xyz.",
