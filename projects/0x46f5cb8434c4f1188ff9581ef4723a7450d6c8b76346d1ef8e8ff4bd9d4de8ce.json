  "impactDescription": "Instead of creating a fork, we're incorporating support for OP Stack directly into the Nethermind Client. This means users can use the same client for all Ethereum and OP Stack chains, ensuring a consistent experience. Additionally, any new features implemented in the client will be immediately available for OP Stack chains.",
  "contributionDescription": "We are bringing the Nethermind Client to Optimism, thereby supporting client diversity and providing node operators with an alternative client design. The Nethermind execution client is a highly configurable Ethereum node built on .NET, offering high compatibility, performance, high-speed synchronization, and healthy node monitoring. We are bringing all of these features to the Optimism Network and all OP Stack-based chains.",
