  "impactDescription": "I am a Music NFT collector on sound xyz. I am a strong member of Camel venture. We are already one of the top NFT collectors. For many weeks in a row we were at the top of the collector chart and the sound even changed to our camel logo.\nAs you can see I have collected 134 music nft and am a backer of 48 artists. I have very famous collections like Rohki, TK, Gray, Mija. I also hope young artists receive more attention. Artists who do not have outstanding works will be motivated to create better quality, more noteworthy music. And a large number of famous outside artists will be active in music NFT. When they see this is a good place like Spotify",
  "contributionDescription": "I am a Music NFT collector on the Optimist network. I have contributed to creating a large number of transactions. Whenever there are new NFTs released by famous artists, the network is often congested in the first 1-2 minutes. But I think Op does this very well. It is not congested at all and the cost is very cheap. I really feel like I'm supporting the Op team very well when experiencing OP's products",
