  "impactDescription": "Impersonator has helped developers in the debugging process for their applications, allowing them to test and verify how their dapps work for different categories of users that hold a particular token or NFTs. They can simulate the calldata for transactions on Tenderly or their local node.\n\nImpersonator has high retention of users that visit the website every day. The browser extension has received a significant number of downloads in the past few months. Exact metrics are shared below.",
  "contributionDescription": "Impersonator has benefitted the following Optimism users:\n- Traders: With impersonator they can log-in to dapps as whale wallets and study how they have setup their positions in detail.\n\n- Dapp users: They can access dapps on-the-go in view-only mode! They no longer have to keep their Metamask or Hardware wallet nearby just to visit the dapp dashboard. Impersonator works without private-keys.\n\n- Developers:\n- They can test how their dapp would respond for users with various token balances\n- Grab the transaction calldata being generated by dapps and simulate it via tenderly",
