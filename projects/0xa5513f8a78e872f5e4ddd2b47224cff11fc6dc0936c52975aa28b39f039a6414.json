  "impactDescription": "MC DAO is a valuable asset to the Mirror community. By providing benefits to 1,865 subscribers and onboarding them to Mirror, MC DAO is helping to grow the Mirror user base. Additionally, MC DAO's work has an indirect impact on onboarding new users to Optimism, as Mirror is the most active Web3 content platform on Optimism.",

By manually curating Web3 contents published on Mirror, MC DAO is able to ensure that readers are exposed to high-quality content that is likely to be of interest to them. This is a valuable service that can help to improve the overall quality of information that is available online.",
