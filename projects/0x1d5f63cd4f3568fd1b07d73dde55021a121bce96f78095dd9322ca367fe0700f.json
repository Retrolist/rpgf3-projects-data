  "impactDescription": "By creating Nomis Score for LayerZero we attracted a huge number of users who were interested in checking their onchain reputation and get bonuses for doing so. We have 120,000 addresses (minted LayerZero Score - 15005 addresses), and each address among these wallets, in case it interacted with the Optimism Network, saw on the dashboard its transactions, transaction addresses, projects in which these transactions were made, as well as the amount of funds used for bridges between networks or token swaps. In the scoring model created for Rubic - all 5,000 (minted Cross-chain Score 1,644 addresses) interacted with the Optimism Network.\n\nScoreFront page, at the moment we have already added several partners supporting the Optimism Network and plan to expand 30 partners by the end of 2023 year",
  "contributionDescription": "- Attracting new users to the Optimism Network\n- Marketing announcements of interaction in the project's social networks\n- Integration of referral system to attract new users/ encourage activity of existing users\n- Creation of a unique mathematical model for evaluating users' onchain activity based on users' interaction with contracts in the Optimism Network\n- Adding the optimism network as one of the main networks for assessing user reputation in the LayerZero Score\n- Partnerships with projects that use the Optimism Network/ are part of the Optimism ecosystem or aspire to become part of it.\n- We would like to become part of the optimism ecosystem and give users of ecosystem projects even more bonuses, and give projects the possibility to evaluate the reputation of their users.",
