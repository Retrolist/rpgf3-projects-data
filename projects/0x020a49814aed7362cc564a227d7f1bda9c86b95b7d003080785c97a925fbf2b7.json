  "impactDescription": "We completed the RFG-7 for ERC-6551 no code tooling. We are the only place in which you can create a net new TBA collection on Optimism and Base. \n\nWe also have built tooling to turn existing NFTs into TBAs on Optimism and Base. \n\nWe have spent significant time building this out and designing the UX to help kickoff the creation of more ERC-6551 NFTs.\n\nWe are still working on go to market, but wanted to apply for RPG as we have completed the RFG.",
  "contributionDescription": "We would like to receive RetroPGF for our ERC-6551 tooling. \nWe have built a website called tokenbound.world that let's you create new ERC-6551 NFTs, deploy existing NFTs into an ERC-6551, and transfer assets to them instantly. \n\nWe've completed a lot of the requirements for RFG-7: Tooling for 6551 - Tokenbound accounts. Building a no-code user interface that allows a NFT creator to:\n\nCreate a net new collection with tokenbound accounts or turn any of their collections on OP Chains into tokenbound accounts\n\nIssue tokens to any tokenbound accounts associated with their collection\n\nWe are the only place where you can create new Tokenbound accounts on Optimism. \n\nWe also created a subgraph for ERC-6551\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
