  "contributionDescription": "All cryptocurrency transactions are recorded in one large virtual network called the blockchain. The blockchain can be visualized as an infinite chain that consists of individual blocks. The blocks, in turn, store information about all transactions made in the cryptocurrency market. Thus, the blockchain is made up of individual nodes, behind which users or groups of users are hidden.",
