  "impactDescription": "I guess by being an early user, ive been useful for you to develop an even safer environment of DeFi, which i guess is priceless for developers in the early-stages of app-building, i always tried to contribute (at my small level) in blockchain community (ive been early user of Uniswap/Ampleforth/1inch/Pancakeswap/Bifi....and many others blockhaus including Optimism, Fantom, Arbitrum...)\n\nI didnt make any contribution on Github as im only a user.",
  "contributionDescription": "I've been a early user of OP bridge back in 2021, and never was eligible for the previous rounds, not sure why because i made an early use of the bridge and some Dapps as well during the 1st weeks.\nI must say OP is really simplifying ETH use, i'm pretty confident it will see a growth in users.",
