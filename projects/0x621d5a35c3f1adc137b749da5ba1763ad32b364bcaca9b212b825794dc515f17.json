  "impactDescription": "* I learned about Optimism governance and how we all can be badgeholders and participate in the governance.\n* I met some friends in the journey: Brichis, Lau and Asshu from HerDao. She organised workshops to talk about Optimism ecosystem from governance to how to create NFTs (that I love). \n* All of those knowledge got me a curiosity for Optimism NFTs and Governance, and now I\u2019m in the ecosystem and learning each day about Optimism ecosystem. \n* I created some videos to my community, so they can mint their first NFT and have notion about Optimism ecosystem. ",
  "contributionDescription": "* I launched my first NFT collection in Zora in the Optimism network. \n* I educated some of my friends from WBiz community to learn more about Optimism ecosystem and web3 basic knowledge. \n* I organised workshops to my community about how to create your first NFT collection with Optimism. \n* I onboard some of them in the Optimism Foro. \n* I participated in the web3 revolution tour onboarding people to web3. The first step was create a wallet and add Optimism network in MetaMask. \n* I represented Women Biz in the Pheyiyex\u2019s interview about Retro PGF2 and inviting more people to create projects in Optimism network. She is Optimism ambassador. \n",
