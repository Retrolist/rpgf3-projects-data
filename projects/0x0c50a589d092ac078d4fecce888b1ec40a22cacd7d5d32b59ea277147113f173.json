  "impactDescription": "Ethereum Mainnet transactions are too expensive for the average user, by utilizing CCIP-Read eth.limo allows users and dApp developers to host static sites in a cost effective manner. This in return opens up the ability for the average person to create blogs/dApps and more without paying absurd gas fees or associated hosting costs. Vitalik has discussed the importance of CCIP-Read for end-user adoption. ",
  "contributionDescription": "Recently we announced our release of limo-web3-dns which is an experimental domain specific implementation of the DNS protocol for direct resolution of ENS records over DNS.\nLimo-web3-dns allows ENS domain holders to be able to manage traditional services such as web hosting and self hosted software with minimal friction. The ultimate goal of limo-web3-dns is to provide trustless auditable cryptographically signed ENS over DNS to bring ENS to parity with DNS. Limo-web3-dns is also  CCIP-Read/EIP-3668 enabled allowing users to store content on Optimism/Base or any L2.  \n\nWe also operate eth.limo as a public good which is a CCIP-Read enabled gateway. Large projects such as Kwenta and Synthetix are utilizing the gateway to provide front-end access to their end users. ",
