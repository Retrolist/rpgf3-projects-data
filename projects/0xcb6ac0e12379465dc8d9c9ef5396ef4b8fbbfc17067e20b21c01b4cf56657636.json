  "impactDescription": "Projects using Tenderly on OP have been executing on average 100,000+ events/month across our platform. 8/10 leading projects and 30+ projects in total on OP as well as over 2000 individual users currently using our services, with an average MAU of 434.",
  "contributionDescription": "Since integrating Optimism (14/7/2021), Tenderly has brought essential infrastructure and tools into both the OP ecosystem and the area of network portability, allowing teams to build instantly and move across Web3 with ease. Developers now simplify, automate, and speed up testing with CI/CD pipelines, end-to-end tests, and robust dApp staging environments synced with live data. They also simulate complex scenarios to ensure contracts and transactions execute as expected before deployment, and the observability solutions enable developers to set up custom alerts and automated responses for instant incident management. Finally, with API and SDK devs easily interact with and extend Tenderly functionalities, and access data in order to create workflows that work best for them.",
