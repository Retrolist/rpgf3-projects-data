  "impactDescription": "As I said translations into Russian and Ukrainian attract the Russian-speaking and Ukrainian-speaking community that lives all over the world. My main goal is to provide content for educational purposes and attract new users to Superchain by my educational content. You can see how many people was involved in Ambassador Program because of my thread (I give an impact metrics below).",
  "contributionDescription": "First of all, I am ambassador-in-training (already for 14 weeks) and now I'm waiting when ambassadors will vote for my  promotion to ambassador.\nI create content, including for educational purposes to attract new users to Superchain. I create articles, Twitter threads, translations, infographics. Also, as a designer, I create NFT by my own design on Base, Zora, OP. I write articles not only on my own, but also for the newspaper \"The Optimist\" and earlier for \"Optimism News\". Translations into Russian and Ukrainian attract the Russian-speaking and Ukrainian-speaking community that lives all over the world. My main goal is to provide content for educational purposes and attract new users to Superchain.",
