  "impactDescription": "Fostering a Positive Environment: Positive contributions, whether through words, actions, or ideas, can help create a more optimistic and supportive atmosphere within the community. This can improve the overall well-being of its members. Encouraging Collaboration: Contributions that promote teamwork and collaboration can enhance the collective's ability to work towards common goals and solve problems effectively. \nThe artists on soundxyz are really very good, soundxyz has made a wise move to put mint Music NFTs on Optimism to attract a large number of users because Optimism network fees are very cheap, almost 0, not only that, the speed is also the best. Fast, that's also the reason I really like and support Optism",
  "contributionDescription": "Sorry my twitter and github accounts are just created. I know this program through the Camel group on telegram. I also minted a few music NFTs on the Optimism network and voted there, and I'm still keeping my votes. My owner uses Telegram so I don't have a github and twitter account, sorry for the inconvenience.  I bought the above OP number from OKX and withdrew it to my wallet to vote on Optimism. Recently, not only did I participate in the OP delegate, but I also supported musicians on soundxyz. Some of my songs have reached the top mint here and used the ref link from Camel ventures. It was from here that I learned about Music NFTs and I fell in love with Optimism even more. ",
