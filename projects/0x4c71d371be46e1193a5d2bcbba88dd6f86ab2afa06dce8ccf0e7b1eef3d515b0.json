  "contributionDescription": "Composable Hub is the first and largest portal and aggregator for Autonomous Worlds(AWs) and Fully Onchain Games(FOCGs). The aggregator part is currently supporting Ethereum and Optimism only. \n\nCurrently, FOCGs are in a very early stage, but many believe they have the greatest potential in the future. \n\nMany FOCG developers in this field need more user traffic. We have listed over 40 FOCG projects on our website, of which about 15% are on Optimism. We help them arrange their basic information, social media, asset data, and more, making it easier for players to find and understand.\n\nWe have also assisted many FOCG projects in playtests or tournaments, receiving very positive feedback in the community, thus we have established good relationships with many FOCG projects, including Lattice.",
