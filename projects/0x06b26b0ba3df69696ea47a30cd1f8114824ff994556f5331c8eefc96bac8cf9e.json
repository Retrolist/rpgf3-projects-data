  "impactDescription": "Thousands of aspiring auditors have participated in free RACEs held every month since Jan'22 (avg ~200/RACE in 2023). Top-32 leaderboards were published & NFTs awarded for reputation. This continues to build Ethereum security community & talent in a permissionless & inclusive manner.\n\nRACEs designed by external researchers (2023: Joran+Goncalo @ ConsenSys Diligence, Nurit @ Certora,  Jon @ Veridise, Hickupp, Josselin @ ToB, Pashov, Hari @ Spearbit, Noah @ Spearbit and Tincho @ Red Guild) bring different perspectives & help enhance the social layer of Ethereum security by encouraging interactions.\n\nRACEs help participants get better at security, assess themselves and achieve greater success at audits, become security-minded developers or get hired by leading Ethereum security projects.",
  "contributionDescription": "Secureum Bootcamp Epoch Infinity (Jan'22 onwards) has a 3-phase \u2014 LEARN-RACE-CARE \u2014 process. Participants LEARN for free from prior Secureum content and external resources. RACEs are open-and-free smart contract security quizzes, created by Secureum Mentors who are leading external security researchers, meant to educate & evaluate aspiring smart contract security auditors & developers as they LEARN basics of Ethereum, Solidity, smart contract security vulnerabilities & exploits. CAREs are smart contract security workshops with collaborating partners. This RetroPGF application is for Secureum Bootcamp Epoch Infinity RACE contributions towards increasing the quality and quantity of Ethereum/Optimism security talent.",
