  "impactDescription": "- RainbowKit's (RK) fast, easy and highly customizable set up has made it easier for developers to build and deploy dapps on multiple networks. \n-RK has become the leading \"Connect Wallet\" SDK, powering 27% of top 100 dapps across chains, including Optimism, Base, and Zora's native web properties and Optimism's official starter kit.\n- RK is committed to supporting OP Stack chains out of the box, adding Zora Chain and Base at launch with all network branding.\n- RK network management improvements make switching, connecting and signing transactions with OP chains easy and reliable for users. Users are 39% more likely to complete transaction on OP chain in dapps that use RK vs other connectors. Users are 139% more likely to switch networks after completing a transaction in RK dapps. ",
  "contributionDescription": "Prior to RainbowKit, building a \u201cConnect Wallet\u201d experience was big overhead and required frequent maintenance for developers.  For users, connecting to dapps was a convoluted and unstable experience. Particularly, switching between networks caused friction that often blocked users from experimenting with L2s like Optimism. \n\nWe built RainbowKit to be the best connect-to-wallet experience for users and the best integration experience for developers. RainbowKit makes connecting your wallet and switching networks a smooth, reliable and enjoyable experience. RainbowKit is fast, easy and highly customizable for developers to install and maintain.\n\nRainbow built RainbowKit to be an open-source public good. Rainbow does not track data or monetize from the SDK. ",
