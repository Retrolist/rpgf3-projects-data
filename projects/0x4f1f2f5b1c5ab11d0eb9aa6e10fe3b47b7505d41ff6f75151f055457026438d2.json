  "impactDescription": "As mentioned in the first description, I have covered the Optimism network and ecosystem quite extensively. I will include links to each of my videos, as well as the viewer count for each one. I have had quite a lot of engagement on youtube and twitter from new and experienced users asking for help navigating campaign tasks and projects on Optimism.",
  "contributionDescription": "As stated in my profile, I am a blockchain researcher helping to demystify digital assets and blockchain technology for new and experienced users. My biggest focus has been performing quest campaigns around the ecosystem, as this is a perfect way for new users to get a better understanding of different projects and how to utilize digital assets, DeFi, and NFTs to their advantage. I have uploaded around 20 videos covering the Optimism Network and Ecosystem that includes an extensive multi-part series on the Optimism Quests from September thru November 2022.",
