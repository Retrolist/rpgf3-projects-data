One type of asset that will soon be recognized by the SEC is NFTs. The PFP NFT market has seen a lot of success in the previous cycle, and in this cycle, music NFTs will play an important role. OP helps make it accessible to users due to low gas fees.\n\nWe (UNWA and CamelVentures) love music and crypto, and we want to spread music NFTs as well as the spirit of sharing for the OP community.",
