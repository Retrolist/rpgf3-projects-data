  "impactDescription": "Our application AikiSend had contributed to unifying the Defi ecosystem on optimism, by leveraging token permission routed through uniswap permit2 library, this allows for a more transparent and seamless on-chain transaction for batched multisend and transfers of different tokens in one transaction, saving gas and time for end-user.\nAikiCloud cloud server rental platform can now allow Optimism users to have access to powerful web2 cloud infrastructure, all from their web3 wallet without having to go through the hassle of setting up a web2 payment gateway or KYC etc. This helps drive user adoption for Optimism Collective and we continue to increase the services we currently support. ",
  "contributionDescription": "Our applications Aikisend and Aikicloud are deployed to work on optimism,\nFirst Aikisend allows OP users to now trustlessly multisend any ERC-20 tokens, all in a single transaction by leveraging the state of the art permit2 library from uniswap.\nAlso we've built Aikicloud which is a cloud service rental model based on the ERC-4907 NFT rental standard.",
