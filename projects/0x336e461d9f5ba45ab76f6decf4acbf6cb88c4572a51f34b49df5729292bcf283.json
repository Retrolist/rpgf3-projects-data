  "impactDescription": "Launched just over two months ago, more than 70,000 users have saved access to their Beam wallets by signing in with X. More than 33,000 users now hold ECO on Optimism, almost entirely through Beam. Beam users are able to access the benefits of using the OP Stack to transfer value globally with low fees, but without needing to worry about much of the complexity that comes with typical crypto wallets.  \n",
  "contributionDescription": "Beam is an attempt at what a Superchain wallet should look like. It solves the user confusion that can result from assets spread across multiple rollups. Beam\u2019s \u2018Supersend\u201d feature is fully operational and has already proven that a solution to this challenge exists and that it can be delivered to users in a tool that is fast, cheap and a delight to use \u2014 with more than 70,000 users saving access to their Beam wallets.
