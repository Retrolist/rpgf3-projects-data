  "impactDescription": "I've taught others how to approach governance in DeFi when they previously had zero experience. I've convinced others to be a participant rather than a spectator, and taking ownership of their experience with blockchain, particularly with Optimism as it is one of the blockchains with the most potential. ",
  "contributionDescription": "I've taught thousands of people how to be successful in DeFi. In doing so, i've talked about Optimism as the place to find: opportunity, availability, scalability, and community. I enjoy teaching people that DeFi is approachable to all and Optimism continues to be a favorite that I talk about in each of my communities whether on Twitter or Alpha Ventures/ZZZMoneyClub.",
