  "impactDescription": "OP Stack\n- My projects showcase the modularity of the OP Stack and prove the technical feasibility of multiple types of modifications of it.\n- The Cannon prover for Concrete is a particularly good example of an instance where a VM-based rollup proof (OP Stack) is superior to a program-based one (e.g., most zkEVMs).\n- I lowered the barrier of entry for developers to to build custom rollups using the OP Stack by building some of the necessary tooling (e.g., Concrete) and setting a foundation for other forks to build on.\n\nDeveloper Ecosystem\n- I accumulated over 100k views on Twitter related to OP Stack forks.\n- My work convinced other developers to build on the OP Stack.\n- Two of my projects (ticking-optimism and ticking-conway) are featured in the OP Stack documentation.",
  "contributionDescription": "Over the last year, I have built multiple forks of the OP Stack in an effort to push the boundaries of what is possible on-chain; some of them have been featured in the OP Stack documentation. The scope of my forks includes the rollup driver (op-node) and execution engine (op-geth). Some of these projects are:\n- Ticking-Optimism: A fork of op-node that adds a system transaction calling a predefined address every block.\n- Concrete: A framework for building application-specific rollups on the OP Stack.\n- Shadow Rollup: An indexer rollup that tracks the gas consumption of every smart contract in another rollup by re-deriving it from L1 with a custom execution engine.",
