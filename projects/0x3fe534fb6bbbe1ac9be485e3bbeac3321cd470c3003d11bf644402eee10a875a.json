That's 19%.\n\nOut of 61mint, 24 people repeat and buy my works, and the repeat rate is 39%. My work contributes to promoting the use of OP/BASE, rather than just one-time use.\n\n\n(2) I have written a step-by-step procedure\nI wrote a step-by-step procedure for starting low-cost BASE NFTs, and the tweet received over 3,700 views.",
  "contributionDescription": "I did 2 things.\n(1) By creating open edition NFTs, participants experienced the low gas fees of OP/BASE.\n\n(2) I have written a step-by-step procedure for starting low-cost BASE NFTs from scratch to show people the way.\n\n\nI enlightened NFT artists and collectors that not only ETH mainnet but also Optimism/BASE NFTs are good.\n\nI like open edition NFTs, which can be disseminated to a large number of people at a low cost. This means less burden on both artists and collectors.",
