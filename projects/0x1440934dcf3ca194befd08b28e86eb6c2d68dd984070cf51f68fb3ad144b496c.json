  "impactDescription": "From the direct feedback we receive, both on Discord & Telegram as well as in person during conferences, we know that our work is helping shape the way Ethereum and L2 ecosystems evolve.\n- The risk assessment and stages frameworks serve as a north star for projects in terms of what they should prioritize in their roadmaps.\n- Our contract monitoring ensures that no changes to the security parameters of any L2 go unnoticed.\n- The introduction of TVL breakdown spurred discussion on how we should treat L2 assets depending on their origin.\n- Our work on L2 upgradeability is now the backbone of security council designs in various protocols.\n- Due to our active participation in governance, we\u2019re now experimenting with different forms of involvement and outreach to the community.",
