  "impactDescription": "Goals and Objectives:\n1. Simplify Onboarding.\n2. Increase User Adoption.\n3. Community Engagement.\n4. Educational Resources.\n\nChallenges Faced:\nIntegrating Optimism's Layer 2 solution with Perpetual Protocol presented technical challenges that required extensive collaboration with developers. Educating users about Layer 2 technology and the advantages of using Optimism required a concerted effort through clear and accessible resources.\n\nScaling Impact: Our success will serve as a model for fostering user adoption and onboarding across other blockchain projects, ultimately contributing to the growth of the entire blockchain ecosystem.\n\n",
  "contributionDescription": "The Optimism Collective's commitment to transparency and collaboration stood out. As my involvement deepened I transitioned from passive to active participation, collaborating on real-world blockchain solutions. Through the collective, I learned that blockchain's true power lies in its communities.\n\nWith RetroPGF, I could add or create a better cohort with talents in onboarding and educating new or seasoned users to better understand and leverage on-chain application.",
