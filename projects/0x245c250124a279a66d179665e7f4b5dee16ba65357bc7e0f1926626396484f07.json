  "impactDescription": "My contributions have had a positive impact on the Optimism Collective by enhancing the understanding of Optimism's activities and financial health. The creation of a dedicated dashboard provides Optimism users with valuable insights, empowering them to make informed decisions. Additionally, my work on Rollup Economics, alongside co-researchers at 4Pillars, has contributed to a broader comprehension of Optimism's economic dynamics and its place within the modular blockchain landscape. This knowledge fosters a more comprehensive and informed approach within the Optimism Collective, aiding in strategic planning and decision-making.",
  "contributionDescription": "As a researcher and data analyst at M3TA, I've contributed to Optimism by creating a dashboard aimed at offering users a comprehensive view of its activities and financial health. Collaborating with my co-researchers at 4Pillars, we've initiated a series on Modular Blockchains. My specific focus lies in Rollup Economics, where I analyze the Cost, Revenue, and Profit Models of layer-2 blockchains, including Optimism, zkSync, and zkEVM. These efforts aim to provide valuable insights into Optimism's economic aspects and its role in the blockchain ecosystem.",
