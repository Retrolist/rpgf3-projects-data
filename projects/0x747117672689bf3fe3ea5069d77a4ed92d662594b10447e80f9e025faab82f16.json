The ecosystem of optimism are quite unique and special, compare to other rollup or layer1 on-chain scaling solution work. The OP roll up is more smooth, even CZ from binance using it to make opBNB!. Look how far we go ",
  "contributionDescription": "I educate thai people that blockchain and Layer2 especially op rollup will change the entire finance industry. Now a day I do my step day by day and one person to person. All over it will take quite sometime to do it, but i hope some day people will understand what I am talking about. Let's make OP the history of the space. !!   ",
