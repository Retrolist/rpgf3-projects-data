  "impactDescription": "- Through regular coverage of Optimism and its ecosystem in its media outlets, both the number and quality of online users has been increased.\n\n- Thanks to my advice, right now one of the development teams is building their product on your blockchain. They were choosing between Arbitrum and Optimism, and I helped them make the right decision.",
  "contributionDescription": "- I actively support many projects built on Optimism through Gitcoin-donations. I don't miss a single round.\n\n- Being a major Influencer and having some connections in the crypto community at the same time, I periodically actively recommend Optimism to my audience and colleagues (always from the bottom of my heart).\n\n- I am a fairly early user of the Optimism network (since November 2022), actively participating in all activities - for example, I have completed all Optimism quests.\n\n- Within 3 months we plan to start developing our own project on Optimism. At the moment we are at the stage of forming a team, funding has already been raised.",
