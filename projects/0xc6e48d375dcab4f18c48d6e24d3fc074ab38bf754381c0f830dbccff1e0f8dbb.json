  "impactDescription": "We have collaborated with the Optimism team on the design and implementation of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, which aims to reduce transaction fees by up to 100x. We aim to enable Optimism to realise its full potential when it comes to improving the scalability and cost-effectiveness of the network.",
  "contributionDescription": "Nimbus is a client implementation for both Ethereum\u2019s consensus layer and execution layer that strives to be as lightweight as possible in terms of resources used. This allows it to perform well on embedded systems, embedded devices \u2013 including Raspberry Pis and mobile devices.\n\nHowever, resource-restricted hardware is not the only thing Nimbus is good for. Its low resource consumption makes it easy to run Nimbus efficiently in L2 networks with higher throughput that may require additional workloads on the same server.\n\nNimbus is trying to accelerate the development of L2 protocols such as OP through the ongoing work on EIP-4844.",
