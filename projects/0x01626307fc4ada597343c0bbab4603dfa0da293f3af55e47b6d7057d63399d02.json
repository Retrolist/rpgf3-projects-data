  "impactDescription": "Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) Round 3 will take place this fall and will distribute 30M OP to reward contributions that have supported the development and adoption of Optimism.\n\nBadgeholders (voters in RetroPGF) need to be able to discover and vote on nominated projects. A good voting experience is core to supporting the work of badgeholders and ensuring an accurate RetroPGF process.  \n\nRound 2 of RetroPGF put a high burden on the voting experience of badgeholders, requiring them to do a lot of manual work spreadsheets and forms.  This friction limited the overall accuracy of the RetroPGF round.",
