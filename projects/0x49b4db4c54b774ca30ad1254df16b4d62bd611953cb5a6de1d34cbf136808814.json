We have 12K subscribers and 2.3K Invest in Music pass holders. \n\nOptimism Onchain Curator Program\n\nWe drove 370 mints, 0.67 ETH volume, and onboarded five artists, creating great content every step of the way.\n\nPartnerships\n\nWe work closely with projects such as Mirror, First Mate, Spinamp, and Collect Pods, who prioritized their Optimism integration at our request.",
