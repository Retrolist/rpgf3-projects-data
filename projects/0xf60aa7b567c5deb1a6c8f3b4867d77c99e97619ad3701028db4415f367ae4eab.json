  "impactDescription": "IPFS is a system for moving data across decentralized networks, with >11M weekly users and 250K public p2p nodes. Highlights:\n\n1. Off-chain storage. IPFS provides verifiable, off-chain storage, often used to reduce on-chain needs in Ethereum & Optimism. Examples: TrueBlocks (local IPFS-based index for EVM chains, built with grants from OP & EF), Snapshot (IPFS-based off-chain voting).\n\n2. Go-to distribution network for fully decentralized third-party app frontends (for gaming, DeFi, & more). We run gateway services that serve 900M requests/wk, and added native IPFS support to browsers like Chromium & Brave.\n\n3. NFT metadata gold standard. Over 115M NFTs are stored on IPFS, including leading platforms OpenSea (which supports Optimism NFTs), Rarible, and Zora.\n",
  "contributionDescription": "- Development and maintenance of the IPFS protocols and specifications.\n- Operation of two major IPFS gateways.\n- Production of one major IPFS implementation (kubo).\n- Advocacy, governance work, and clear specifications with an open and legitimate process to support the wider community.\n- Documentation and code examples to help people use IPFS.\n- Bringing IPFS to browsers, browser engines, and in cURL so as to support better dApps and bridge web2 over.",
