  "contributionDescription": "15M Brazilians own crypto assets, however the lack of crypto-related subjects in regular school materials underscores a gap in the conventional curriculum.\n\nWe aim to increase safety and awareness around web3, and offer students hope and the technological tools to build a better future.\n\nHence, we've created a ReFi fundamentals 2h workshop and a ReFi entrepreneurship 12-week program aimed at public school students from 13-17. \n\nWe're focusing on public schools to make sure this technology can benefit traditionally underserved communities. \n\nWe're aiming at high school students to provide them with different perspectives for the future. \n\nBnE is the first and most successful educational initiative that brings Web3 content through the ReFi lens to regular public schools in Brazil.",
