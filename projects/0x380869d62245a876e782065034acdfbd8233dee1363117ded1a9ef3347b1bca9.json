  "impactDescription": "Grateful's primary impact on the Optimism Collective is providing the entire community of projects, creators, and individuals within the Optimism ecosystem with a seamless method for recurring payments.

  "contributionDescription": "Grateful addresses the global challenge of monetization for diverse entities like projects, individuals, communities, creators, and DAOs, often struggling to monetize their contributions. Traditional solutions rely on sponsors or donations, rarely incorporating gratitude or recurring payments.\n\nEmphasizing the importance of recurring payments (subscriptions), Grateful establishes a predictable economic model, ensuring consistent support. The core lies in balancing giving and receiving. Grateful operates as a public good, charging 0% fees to both creators and subscribers. Sustainability is maintained through its own subscriptions, aligning with the model advocated for others.",
