  "impactDescription": "My archival nodes have allowed developers & users to have unlimited access to RPC api with free of charge. My nodes have served more than 3 billion requests in the last two months. It has made the developers life easy because they can use these nodes without having to worry about api limits and expensive bills.",
  "contributionDescription": "I run BASE archival nodes as a public good service. They are free of charge with no IP tracking and api limits. I pay for the servers from my pocket with no outside funding or grant. I also maintain them myself with no outside help. There have been no issues with the nodes infrastructure since I launched them in August.",
