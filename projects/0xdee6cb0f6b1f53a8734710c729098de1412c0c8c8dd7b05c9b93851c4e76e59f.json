  "contributionDescription": "Web3ForGood is a media community run by two friends in the nonprofit and social impact sectors. We publish a weekly newsletter, \"This Week in Web3ForGood,\" aiming to demystify Web3 tech for social impact professionals. The platform serves as a bridge between tech builders and those focused on social change, offering educational opportunities and content at the intersection of tech and impact. Notably, the newsletter introduced the concept of Optimism to a curious yet skeptical audience. This sparked interest in Quadratic Funding, Impact Certificates, the Merge, and Rollups, leading to a detailed series on Optimism. Growth has been organic, emphasizing the community's value in facilitating meaningful discourse.\n",
