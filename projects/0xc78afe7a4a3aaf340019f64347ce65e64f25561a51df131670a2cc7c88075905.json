  "impactDescription": "We deployed & funded Gas Tap on Optimism. Thousands of unique users have claimed gas from the Optimism Gas Tap to use the Optimism Network. Furthermore, It's a community-based product, and everyone can fund it. It makes it so easy for everyone to obtain the gas token they need to use the Optimism network.\n\nWe deployed both Token Tap and Prize Tap contracts on the Optimism Network and ran a Proof of Concept via Token Tap that shows how they can be used to reward users for on-chain activities in the Optimism network.\n\nWe set a token distribution of 0.1 $OP for the first 1000 unique users who claimed ETH on OP Gas Tap.",
  "contributionDescription": "Onboarding new users to web3 has always been a challenge.\n\nUnitap makes sure everyone\u2019s initial steps into Web3 are free, easy, and understandable. People can earn rewards that are only going to UNIQUE HUMANS thanks to BrightID and other Sybil resistance tools.\n\nUnitap includes 4 Taps and 3 of them are live:\n1. Gas Tap: Unique humans can obtain a tiny amount of gas tokens on almost all the major EVM networks to start using them.\n\n2. Prize Tap is where people can create raffles and gate them with the requirements they want.\n\n3. Token Tap is where anyone can distribute any kind of tokens gated by the requirements they wish.\n\nWe deployed all 3 Taps on Optimism and created an incentive program via Token Tap as a PoC. So, Unitap is ready for token distribution and raffle creation on Optimism.",
