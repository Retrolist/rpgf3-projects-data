  "impactDescription": "Aside from BSC (our native chain), OP and Base Chain are our top TVL chains right now\n\n- On OP: 26 vaults. Launched Nov\u201922. TVL at $4.5M+ (ATH of $11M+ in Mar)\n- key ecosystem vaults like OP and OP-ETH\n\n- On Base: 22 vaults. Launched Sep\u201923. TVL at $1.2M+\n- Supported Base LPs and vaults, eg USDbC, cbETH\n\nOur ACLM maintained a tight range on V3 positions, hosting a big % of active liquidity on the pools managed. This facilitated better + bigger swap volumes on key tokens.\n\nMetrics - Currently hosting:\n90%+ of active liquidity on UniV3 for USDT/DAI, USDC/USDT\n20%+ on wstETH/ETH\n50%+ on USDC/USDbC\n\n- We actively posted developments about OP in our socials, bringing user awareness to OP/Base\n- Other initiatives: sharing our content to OP Discord, + sharing insights in OP community Spaces\n",
