  "impactDescription": "Since deploying on Optimism, the Pyth oracle has become the go-to infrastructure for anyone building DeFi that requires low-latency data \u2014 apart from PERP Protocol, all derivatives platform live on Optimism have become #PoweredByPyth ; this amount to close to 99% market share on that segment.\n\nApplications that are #PoweredByPyth on Optimism have initiated close to 500,000 txs on OP mainnet (to update the Pyth price feeds) so that their protocol could properly function. We estimate that about 385 ETH have been spent (either by apps or users\u2019 of said apps) to update the Pyth prices on-chain. As the number of #PoweredByPyth applications increase, and market share of existing applications increases, it is expected to see many more txs initiated to update the Pyth Price Feeds on Optimism.",
  "contributionDescription": "- Deployed the Pyth smart contract on Optimism mainnet on Sep-09-2022\n\nThis Pyth smart contract enables anyone to request and permissionlessly update prices on-chain for about 350 assets \u2014 this enables anyone building a DeFi app to integrate a critical piece of infrastructure in its protocol.\nTo date, the Pyth oracle has supported (that we know of) 10 DeFi applications building on Optimism (Synthetix, Kwenta, Polynomial, Thales, Pika, Lyra, Unidex, Avantis Finance, Pike Protocol). \n\n- Released its OP/USD price feed to Optimism and 35 different blockchains\n\nFor instance, two leading perpetual protocols that use Pyth on Arbitrum: Vela Exchange and HMX, have launched OP markets thanks to the Pyth Price Feed.",
