  "impactDescription": "Impact has been in the form of measurable value, technical contributions, and less-tangible efforts:\n\n* ~$2.5 million (~1% of airdrop #1) OP reallocated from sybil hunters to real Optimism users with Hop DAOs sybil repo.\n* Established standards for cross-chain bridging and messaging. Provided insights, feedback, and code to be reused in L2 systems. Co-authored EIP-5164 to help developers easily integrate with L2s.\n* Over $700 million and 325k unique users onboarded into the Optimism ecosystem.\n* Over 1 million txs made on Optimism chains, translating to 250+ ETH in fees paid to secure Optimism.\n* Gave feedback to Optimism about the code and SDK and offered suggestions.\n* Distributed 250k OP with a novel mechanism for token distribution, adopted by other teams for onboarding into Optimism.",
  "contributionDescription": "Hop Protocol has created an L2 bridge experience that has helped over 300k users onboard more than $725 million into the Optimism ecosystem and has accounted for over 1 million transactions on Optimism chains. Hop has supported Optimism and Base since day 1 of their public launches, as well as their respective testnets.\n\nHop has established standards for cross-chain bridging and messaging. These contributions have provided valuable insights that have influenced the design and growth of the L2 ecosystem & created EIP-5164.\n\nOn the non-technical side, Hop developed a Sybil detection framework used by Optimism, filtering out over 2k Sybil hunters from Optimism Airdrop\u00a0#1. Hop also introduced a novel mechanism for OP token distribution, adopted by other teams to boost onboarding into Optimism.",
