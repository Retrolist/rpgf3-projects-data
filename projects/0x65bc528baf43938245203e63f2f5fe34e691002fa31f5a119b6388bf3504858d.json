  "impactDescription": "I\u2019m just a wannabe influencer. Iv onboarded several people into crypto. I reminded my buddy he had the last drop made sure he did not miss out lol. I really just retweet for the most part. I just want to take part. I honestly didn\u2019t realize this was for a grant when I started. I just try to get involved with the blockchain.",
  "contributionDescription": "I have not contributed much. I have interacted with the chain. However if given an opportunity to have access to some of these spaces. Finances being the biggest barrier for me. I know I can meet the people who can help me get more artists selling music on optimism. Find a way for companies like carmax or caravan to accept crypto through there online delivery apps. Imagine buying a car without ever seeing a salesperson all with your air drop you spent months farming for. All without ever touching fiat. I want to build that space.",
