  "contributionDescription": "EIP are standards for the Ethereum ecosystem. It connects the whole Ethereum community: Ethereum, Optimism, developers, builders, startups, EIP editors/authors, tech writers, etc., but the connections through EIP are weak.\n\nThe EIP Fun project consists of a Website, Community, EIP Fun Newsletter, EIP Tech workshops, etc. to serve EIP builders and scale the whole ecosystem.",
