  "impactDescription": "Zonic has enriched the Optimism ecosystem through both B2C and B2B2C approaches. While our B2C initiatives are detailed elsewhere, we also support businesses leveraging the full OP stack.\n\nFor B2B2C, we guide entities looking to integrate an NFT marketplace within their blockchain using the OP stack.\n\nAnticipating the growth of Layer-2 networks, we understood that building a thriving ecosystem around them is challenging. Hence, Zonic introduced a \"Superchain-compatible\" NFT Marketplace, streamlining integration for businesses.\n\nRecently, we've quickly integrated blockchains like Base Goerli, Base Mainnet, and Zora. Notably, Base Goerli was incorporated just an hour after its launch, highlighting our proactive approach and the value we add to the OP stack ecosystem.",
  "contributionDescription": "Zonic has significantly bolstered the Optimism network, becoming a frontrunner in the NFT arena. Our high-liquidity NFT marketplace serves as a central hub, simplifying exchanges for creators, traders, and artists. This eliminates the need for custom in-app NFT marketplaces, making the experience more user-friendly.\n\nWe've also championed artists, helping them display their work on Optimism, enriching the platform's diversity. This has spiked transaction volumes, energizing the ecosystem.\n\nBeyond just a marketplace, we've introduced captivating activities on Optimism, drawing more users and enhancing its stature among NFT aficionados.\n\nLastly, our dedicated Discord community stands ready to assist users, ensuring a smooth NFT journey on Optimism for everyone.",
