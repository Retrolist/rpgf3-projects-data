  "impactDescription": "I've been some active in the Collective, i don't know if it's the right way but i want to learn and help, also with my suggestions about ethics and how to measure impact, since i know that all the emotions that we can't measure since this place, things like frustration, fear, burnout, and everything that we face trying to help rising numbers and looking to make impact. Also in the events that we are organizing, i'm the coordinator for the Venezuela, Honduras, Mexico, Per\u00fa events, that were headed all with grants from Bankless, without any external funding. I work in RL ethics committee and i would love to learn and give some of my time to help understand more about the goods and the ways of how to govern. ",
  "contributionDescription": "Hiho! i'm more a coordinator that an a builder, but i love my job in web3. I've started in Espacio Cripto Podcast, with a lot of different projects and i realize that it's better if we help more people to get on boarded than make my own journey, i've started Nacion Bankless as a subDAO and i resigned to my position as co founder in Ethereum Mexico. I've been coordinating a lot of projects with no salary and it would be great if you continue my growth in the ecosystem. ",
