  "impactDescription": "1. Deployed a novel governance and access control framework on Optimism that solves critical problems relating to granular roles and custom execution strategies that have not been solved by existing systems. Llama helps save engineering resources of protocol teams.\n\n2. Four Llama instances deployed on Optimism, including two by major protocols\n\n3. $100,000 secured by Llama accounts on Optimism",
  "contributionDescription": "Llama is an onchain governance and access control product that is deployed on Optimism. \n\nUsing Llama, organizations on Optimism can deploy fully independent instances that define granular roles and permissions for executing transactions, known as \"actions\".\n\nLlama instances can adapt to a changing environment by incrementally adding new participants and expanding the set of available actions. Actions include transferring funds, updating a registry, changing protocol parameters, or activating an emergency pause.\n\nLlama's onchain framework is open and permissionless: any org on Optimism can deploy a self-governed Llama instance to create and execute onchain actions. \n\nIn addition to action creation, Llama's app helps users view a public audit trail of roles, permissions, and action history.",
