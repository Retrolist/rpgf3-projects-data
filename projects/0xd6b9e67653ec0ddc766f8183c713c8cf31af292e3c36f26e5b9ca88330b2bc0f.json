  "impactDescription": "Our impact extends beyond theoretical knowledge. We actively participate in OP governance as a delegate for our community and onchain through our educational quests and activities. Our work also empowers community members to grow and become their own agents of change in the ecosystem. \n\nOur delegation wallet address : 0x6a5cC02b7dA4ad7db68688b92836aD10e053b1fE",
  "contributionDescription": "Our goal is to educate the Arab speaking community about crypto, public goods and the Optimistic vision. By offering free educational content, we expose our community to the power of this innovative technology. Our efforts expand beyond content creation, we also gamify and reward the experience to encourage our community to take action onchain and learn by doing various tasks including swaps, bridging, minting, and participating in DeFi. This is important because the bans that exist in many Arab speaking countries limit access to this type of education and keep our community behind. We\u2019re proud to share that many of our community members have grown into devs, builders, and web3 educators. ",
