  "impactDescription": "We envision the Optimism dashboard being the go-to resource for community members since the entire Optimism ecosystem is aggregated into one UI on Alphaday. This makes it a very attractive on-boarding tool for new developers as the dashboard will contain beginner resource material, documentation, grants, bounties, open positions in community projects, on-chain tools and much more.",
  "contributionDescription": "We have built an Optimism Community Dashboard to serve the Community. By having all the latest Optimism-related social feeds, blogs, on-chain metrics and access to dapps themselves, community members can quickly stay informed and interact with the Optimism ecosystem.\nOur complete proposal was published on Optimism Grants here: https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-13585052320942648\nWe were redirected to RPGF's through feedback.",
