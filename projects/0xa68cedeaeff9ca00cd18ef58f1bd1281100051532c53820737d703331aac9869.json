  "impactDescription": "With Base joining optimism as Core Developers to the OP stack, it has powered developers and users to see the vision of layer 2 chains being modular, superchain type rollups. We've focused on creating tools for developers and users such as token lockers/creating a secondary swap for higher risk tokens/perpetual trading and many more. Now with Optimism supporting Base with the shared governance and revenue-sharing feedback is proof of this.",
