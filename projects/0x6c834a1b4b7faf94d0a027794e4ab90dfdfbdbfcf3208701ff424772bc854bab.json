  "impactDescription": "well the impact has not been very impressive because it seems pretty complicated to do anything around here. like I said I put 20 bucks in and now I can't get it back, theres no instructions theres no explanation or anything. and now I have to write this essay because your forcing me to. ",
  "contributionDescription": "where is my money? I put 20 bucks in and now its impossible to take it out. theres no options to take the money out, so where can I get the money out ? please contact me as soon as possible about this very important matter. it doesn't even show the balance on this website, while on my coinbase wallet it shows 20 bucks hidden in a \"volatile op main net\" so how do I figure this out ? thanks ",
