So with this I guess it's safe to say that my contribution has;\n\nOnboarded new users into the OPTIMISM chain.\n\nI wish to still do more in the future and I hope to get the grant not only as a form of encouragement but as a source to produce more onboarding user content I to OP stack.",
  "contributionDescription": "I am a DeFi researcher, as I always engage myself in different optimism campaigns, trying out different protocol application of optimism. I staked on Velodrome during the Taho campaign, minted NFTs and did other things on-chain. But mostly, I would like to receive the RetroPGF for an optimism onboarding content I wrote: \n\nA detailed guide on HOW TO GET INTO OPTIMISM with Metamask.",
