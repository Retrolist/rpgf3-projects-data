  "contributionDescription": "I have a total of 357 Transaction on Optimism network, i have delegated many times and own 100's of NFTs on optimism. I also check optimism website plenty of times so check when im eligible for the NFT PFP.  0x1810bb2Face5711D20F0C5DA104415B96adad122 this is my wallet and this wallet was also eligible for the #1 ditribution of OP tokens, with that distribution i was able to explore much more of the Optimism ecosystem and explored alot, my wallet is almost 1000 days old, i've spend on main-net like 1.6ETH which a big part was bridging to optimism in the bullrun of 2021. I really like the Optimism network and highly recommend everyone to build on it. and centainly think that it has a high potential of being one of the best Layer 2's around there.",
