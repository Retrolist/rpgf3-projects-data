  "impactDescription": "Anotherworld will create an ancient world, introducing characters from Xia, Shang, Zhou and other dynasties, and giving biographies to the characters and even surrounding physical items. Bringing antique-loving users into the crypto world.\n\nThis idea comes from a very popular movie in China this year called \"Chang'an 30,000 Miles\". The box office of this movie reached 250 million US dollars. After watching the movie, I immediately bought the accompanying \"Chang'an 30,000 Miles\" art set. I think Chinese users have demand for ancient style NFT PFP, even though the NFT market is currently in a downturn.",
  "contributionDescription": "anotherworld is a Chinese-style PFP NFT project on Optimism. The project attracts users who love Chinese elements to enter the NFT world and expand to new crypto users.\n\nThe NFT created by this project will focus on ancient characters. The characters are iterated through the changes of dynasties. Different characters reflect the condition of people in different eras, blending Chinese history into it to build an ancient Chinese world and promote the acceleration of the application of cryptocurrency in the real world.",
