  "impactDescription": "Ensuring that the chain allows simple deployment for any average developer including those with little or no experience. In view of this, the simple contract I deployed ensured and proved this and that made me recommend it to other newbies like me who are interested on finding crypto innovations.",
  "contributionDescription": "As a newbie who recently joined the cryptocurrency world around February this year, I set out to check out various chains which had genuine work and were real innovations and one of the top chains I found out about was Optimism. Therefore, I started using the chain to carry out various transactions and recently deployed a smart contract on it. This is my most recent contribution to the chain. I also referred other newbies like me to deploy simple smart contracts on the Op Mainnet.",
