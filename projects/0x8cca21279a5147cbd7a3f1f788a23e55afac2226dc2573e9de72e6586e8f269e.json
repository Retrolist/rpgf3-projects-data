  "impactDescription": "I noted that most of the content focused on app developers was technical. There were many technical intros, guides & documentation, but I felt that this \u201cHow to build a web3 startup\u201d piece was missing.\n\nWhen I started (Nov 2021), if you\u2019d like to learn this knowledge, you\u2019d have to know a web3 founder personally or join acceleration programs where they\u2019ve been mentors.\n\nBut if we want more crypto apps, we need to make this product-building know-how accessible to everyone, regardless of their skill level, wealth & network. So I open-sourced it.\n\nSince the podcast is focused on niche, tactical know-how, it only had a bit more than 1,500 subscribers. My guide also had a bit more than 1,000 readers. But most of these people were crypto devs & founders, and some of them shared their praise.",
  "contributionDescription": "Almost all my web3 projects were focused on helping crypto founders & devs. Primarily by finding know-how that's hard to get and sharing it for free.\n\n1. Web3 Talks: a podcast where top crypto founders take us on a backstage tour and explain how they built their projects. It has 48 episodes so far, incl. interviews with founders of ZORA, WalletConnect, Farcaster, Zapper, Gnosis & many more.\n\n2. Goldmine3: Listeners asked me for a way to browse through stories & tactics shared on the podcast, so I built a searchable repo of real web3 case studies.\n\n3. Product communications guide: As I've spoken with 100+ crypto founders, I found they find it hard to explain what their products do. So I wrote a guide with 40 examples of good & bad practices.\n\n4. GoerliETH: I distributed ca. 30,000 GoerliETH",
