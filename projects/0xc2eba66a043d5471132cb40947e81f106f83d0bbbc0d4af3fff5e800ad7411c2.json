  "impactDescription": "Sushi's cross-chain swaps enable users from various chains to easily join the OP stack. These pioneering efforts foster user cross-pollination, securing strong liquidity vital for projects on the OP stack. Our engagement in the Optimism ecosystem is marked by a significant $239.6M trading volume on both chains YTD, contributing to 15% of Base's total activity. This throughput highlights our essential role in boosting the stack's liveliness and reach. More than just participants, we lead tech evolution, simplifying asset transfers, and liquidity solutions, affirming Sushi's commitment to broadening decentralized finance on the Optimism stack.",
  "contributionDescription": "In 2022, Sushi pioneered cross-chain swaps via LayerZero's Stargate, bridging liquidity and users across networks and fostering user cross-pollination within ecosystems. This first-of-its-kind capability in DeFi enables seamless asset transactions and liquidity provisions across multiple networks, enhancing user migration pathways to OP/Base from platforms like Ethereum Mainnet and Arbitrum. As an early Base protocol adopter, Sushiswap accounts for over 15% of Base's trade volume, affirming its role as a crucial liquidity nexus. This grant aims to fortify Sushi's position within the OP Stack, leveraging revamped tokenomics and robust liquidity incentives to optimize our offerings and user engagement, aligning with our extensive network that has facilitated over $268B in trades.",
