  "impactDescription": "Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) is a mechanism that rewards people and projects for the positive impact they have on the Optimism Collective beyond the profit that they already receive. RetroPGF attempts to balance the equation impact=profit. If you're creating value for the Collective that isn't already being rewarded (e.g., via a sustainable business model), the Collective will do its best to fill the gap through its regular RetroPGF rounds.",
  "contributionDescription": "RetroPGF is a core part of Optimism\u2019s vision. If done right, it will form the backbone for a new type of economy. As with any complex system, though, this new process can\u2019t be centrally planned or designed all at once. The only way to build it well is to build it together. This journey will require care, open-mindedness, patience, and, of course, optimism!",
