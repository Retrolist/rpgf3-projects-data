  "impactDescription": "Retroactive public goods funding is advantageous because it is relatively easy to agree on what is useful, and see who built it. It is a lot harder to identify in advance what will be useful, and which team will do the best job of building it. The possibility of an eventual exit payment can also encourage investors to fund initial public good development efforts until the usefulness is obvious, in the same way that the possibility of an eventual IPO or buy out encourages investors to fund startups today",
  "contributionDescription": "I am very optimistic about this project, and I am also a holder of the OP coin, and I hope that it will be one of the strongest projects as well, because it is considered one of the best digital currency projects in this market. Im very bullish on it ",
