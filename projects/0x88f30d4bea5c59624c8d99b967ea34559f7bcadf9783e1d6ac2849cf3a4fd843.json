  "impactDescription": "DOUBLETOP is one of the biggest crypto community in Eastern Europe and every year we set each year narratives. From the beginning of the 2nd half of 2021 Optimism as well as other L2s on ETH took huge half of our narrative. We have made positive, both direct and indirect impact on overall level of understanding and knowledge of Optimism and other ETH L2s.  \n\nIn regards to impact, we are part of Optimism community and impacted adoption in various ways. The easiest way to measure the impact is probably views for us, however one should also look through likes/comments/activity/quality of the content/quality of the community etc. For that one would need to go directly to the piece of content and look it through. Sometimes even translate.",
  "contributionDescription": "Throughout all of our social media platforms, including Telegram, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram etc. we are frequently debating about ETH L2s including Optimism. Optimism has been DOUBLETOP tier-1 project and ecosystem from the beginning of 2023 since we had included it to our overall narrative. \n\nWe have published posts, tweets, videos, guides, translations, conducted community support about, within and for Optimism, Optimism ecosystem protocols, OP Stack chains + held huge L2 narrative in our community from the very beginning. Needless to say, everyone in our team and most of our community have interacted with Optimism both onchain and on community side at least once. \n\nThanks to all that, the level of Optimism and L2 ETH knowledge has definitely risen significantly.",
