  "impactDescription": "Talking about stats - unfortunately, we are unable to check the amount of people who bought tokens or delegated or smth like that. However, according to typical stat - conversions on public social pages are about 5-10%. Conversions in private communities are more than 20%\n\nMost stats are shown in the google sheet. But in case I missed something or you need more clarification - you are free to contact me via telegram - t.me/voshchansky. Or via email - maximvoshanskiy@gmail.com. And in case you'd like to make a partnership - feel free to contact me also, a year ago we were representatives of Polygon in CIS, for example\n\nSome amount of content that is not related to Union/Academy/YouTube/Telegram but is made by our authors will be attached below",
  "contributionDescription": "There are 4 pages in the table I provided - YouTube, Telegram, Union and Academy\n\nUnion is a private community with 600 people paying participation fees on a monthly basis. So the most interested target audience but I'm unable to give you links since it's a private community\n\nAcademy is an information product. There's also a target audience with money that we're teaching from scratch how to interact with the Web3 world. Same with links as it is in Union\n\nStats:\nYoutube channel: 197k+\nTelegram channel: 72k+\nPrivate TG channel: 650+\nAcademy: 1,3k+\n\nWe made 4 videos on YouTube(maybe even more but that's where OP tokens are shown at least on a Thumbnail)\n\nWe mentioned 28 times OP in our Telegram and made 11 posts literally about Optimism and 3 times mentioned in Daily Digest - it's a podcast\n",
