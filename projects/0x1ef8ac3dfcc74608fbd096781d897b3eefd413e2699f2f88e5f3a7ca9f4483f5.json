  "impactDescription": "I can't give you an idea of the impact yet, because this is a very new project in ecosystem optimism. \n\nI simply created a web3 that is useful for creating personal applications for yourself with the help of blockchain optimism,\n\nso people register without having to give their email or password just by connecting their wallet.",
  "contributionDescription": "I want to build a personal website application based on web3 blockchain and I prefer optimism because it is faster and cheaper.\n\nBuilding a project like this with only my own capital without a team is quite difficult, but I will try, so I need funds to start all this.\n\nand this is the reason I joined the RetroPGF Round 3 program, hopefully I will succeed",
