  "impactDescription": "UX: \nWe separate signals from noise. We are a trusted news source for builders, hence, we\u2018re strengthening the ecosystem. We had 5300+ unique visitors. We have around 80 monthly curators and 1,200 monthly readers.\n\nOP Stack:\nOur p2p protocol helps scale ETH. We use NFTs to authorize who can upvote/submit. We implement identity, i.e., FC and ENS. We store 4700 EIP-712 upvotes on our \u201cside p2p network,\" to minimize onchain storage. We\u2019ve delegated 123 keys to improve UX. We help to scale OP.\n\nDX:\n4 people (including us) have been shipping on Kiwi since April: Kiwi Search, kiwinews.lol and us. Delegator2 is a web3 UX breakthrough. We\u2019ve co-organized DeSo meetups in Denver, Paris & Berlin. We gave talks at Protocol Berg, and Broadcast Summit. We\u2019re growing DeSo on OP.",
  "contributionDescription": "Kiwi helps crypto builders find the best content without social media noise. Our community consumes hundreds of sources a month to handpick and upvote top content for crypto founders & developers. From tweets, through essays, up to Dune dashboards and GitHub repos.\n\nWe a use P2P architecture - similar to Farcaster - so that most heavy data is stored offchain and only the most important elements, such as delegations & NFTs are stored onchain. The architecture promotes credible neutrality as it lets users run p2p nodes or clients with their own UI & moderation rules, such as kiwinews.lol run by our contributor, freeatnet or Kiwi News Search by matallo.\n\nWe are 100% Open Source. Our R&D on scaling ETH via the P2P protocol and OP key delegation  can be reused by others.",
