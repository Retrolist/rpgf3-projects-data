  "impactDescription": "1. We are actively alpha-testing an OP + OP-stack powered digital world with web users and gamers on Epic Games Store and HyperPlay.\n\n2. Another World is bringing Bored Ape Yacht Club members and ApeCoin DAO communities into the Superchain ecosystem through a series of game-related activities and received top votes from the ApeCoinDAO community to fund further experiments.\n\n3. We showcased the shortest path from the official website to entering a 3D world using a web browser. Players can experience the gameplay first before using their wallets.\n\n4. Our open-source code samples (such as Unreal Engine in-game airdrop mechanism and paying on L1 for L2 NFT mints) can bring more game devs into the Superchain ecosystem and reduce the friction of L2 tokens.",
  "contributionDescription": "1. Another World won OP's hackathon prizes and we keep building it into a game-like digital world where players are 3D avatars to continue their web3/NFT adventures. NFTs are game items usable in players' inventory. Tokens can unlock access and gameplay. \n\n2. Another World is an OP+OP-stack game. NFTs can be acquired as in-game airdrops via Optimism. We built our OP-stack for treasure-hunt battles where players win or lose on-chain items. We also supply in-game $OP airdrops for players who retrieve certain game items.\n\n3. Another World showcases a simplified UX for both web3 and web2 players to enter a 3D world. Web3 players opt-in by typing in ENS at the entry menu while web2 users are free to play using an URL. \n\n4. Our progress and game sample codes are open-source on GitHub.",
