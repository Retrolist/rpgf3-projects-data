  "impactDescription": "I was part of a project to develop a web-based application for a university. My team was tasked with creating a web-based application that would allow students to easily check their grades, register for courses, pay fees, and access other university resources. My primary role in the project was to create the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of the application. This involved researching current trends in web-based applications, creating wireframes and mockups of our ideas, and then implementing those designs into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\nI also worked closely with the back-end developers to ensure that the UI/UX I was creating was compatible with their code.
