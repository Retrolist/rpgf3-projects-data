  "impactDescription": "0xSplits makes it easy to reward collaboration onchain and customize payouts. We\u2019ve been used by collectives (e.g. Protocol Guild, Songcamp), DAOs (e.g. Airswap, Bankless, Bouns), applications (e.g. Sound, Superrare, Proof, Transient Labs, Heds, Decent, Bonfire, Arpeggi), artists/musicians (Jonathan Mann, Daniel Allan, Reo Cragun), and devs (e.g. Quantum, Props) to power collaborative & customized payouts. Our open source & free-to-use ecosystem has distributed ~$40M to 10K+ unique accounts on several EVM chains including OP.",
  "contributionDescription": "0xSplits is a suite of smart contracts & tools that allows devs and end users to easily, securely, and efficiently customize onchain payouts. Our current offerings include splits (immutable, mutable, & liquid), waterfalls/recoups (sequential payouts), vests (multi-stream, single beneficiary), swappers (receive any token, output a single type), pass-through wallets (inject governance), and diversifiers (receive any token, output multiple types) as well as the accompanying subgraphs, sdk, & UI.",
