  "impactDescription": "My contributions have introduced diverse voices and innovative narratives to the web3 space. As part of a web3 cultural education team, I've onboarded artists and helped educate 4,000+, expanding the community. While also providing and receiving recognition for dynamic, wide-ranging, and innovative visual artworks.",
  "contributionDescription": "Within the digital landscape, I saw a gap in inclusivity, innovative storytelling, and creator autonomy. Leveraging Web3 tools, I've worked to fill these gaps, cultivating connections and enhancing our collective community. My wide-ranging visual art, recognized in global exhibitions and publications like Time Magazine, pushes the boundaries of creativity. Significant collaborations like onboarding Latasha, the first woman rapper on-chain, shifted paradigms in web3 music. As Creative Director of Zoaratopia, I was a part of educating and onboarding 4,000+ into the web3 space, and \"Helmet City,\" my AI-collaborative universe, not only drew 13,000 collectors and 11 ETH but also spotlights innovative storytelling and creator autonomy.",
