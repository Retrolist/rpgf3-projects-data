  "impactDescription": "I want to test the sophistication or security of the OP's network. I want to test all the applications on OP's network and if possible see what things need to be added. Security is the most important thing in a blockchain network, and I want to contribute to the network security section and I will continue to try to strengthen the security that is so strong in this OP network. I hope someday I can be part of OP's team",
  "contributionDescription": "I want to support the development of many projects in the OP network on an ongoing basis. This is a very good network and has the potential to be even better in the future. As a loyal user of the OP network, I want to bring OP into an ecosystem that is very capable and tested again. Hopefully one day I can become one of the OP team and partner with really great people in blockchain technology.",
