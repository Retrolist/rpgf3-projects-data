  "impactDescription": "Suggestions related to the ecosystem are taken into consideration. And that's really important and gratifying for the community. We can see this in every area of social media. I had previously talked to a friend about the feedback and he stated that his suggestion was taken into consideration. Let's continue to take community suggestions into account.",
  "contributionDescription": "I love using the Optimism network. I have over 300 transactions on this network. I have also participated in donations before. And I delegated my optimism tokens to participate in the voting. These are already obvious things. I will try to continue my interaction with the network as much as I can. Because, as I said, I actively use this network and I love it. Let's keep building!",
