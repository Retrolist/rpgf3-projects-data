  "contributionDescription": "We noticed many find Web3 daunting initially due to its complexity and the constant, intriguing developments within. So, we launched a channel offering one-minute videos, unraveling these topics in an engaging, simple manner. Our first four videos have covered Optimism's role in reducing gas fees, the lucrative MEV bot JaredfromSubway, Michael Egorov's near-fall due to a coding bug, and an insight into Liquid Staking Derivatives easing fund access from staking. Posted across Instagram, Twitter, Shorts, and TikTok, our videos have garnered over 15,000 views, sparking discussions and fostering a curious, informed community around Web3. The journey has just begun; our upcoming videos will continue demystifying the geeky, enriching minds, and making crypto a fun, accessible venture for all.",
