  "impactDescription": "Covalent's onchain data infrastructure has empowered over 559 monthly developers/applications actively building on the Superchain using our Unified API, resulting in 5,291,511 monthly API Calls.\n\nCovalent's tooling has been adopted by many applications within the Optimism ecosystem, including Aave, Bware Labs, Chainlink, Coin98, Curve, Gnosis Safe, Infura, Koinly, KyberSwap, LI.FI, Matcha, NodeReal, QuickNode, Rabby, Raleon, Rainbow, Rotki, Skytale, Tally, Tokensoft, tofuNFT, Utopia Labs, XDEFI, Zapper, and more, enabling them to provide better services to their users.\n\nWith our unified approach to fetch data from OP Mainnet, Base, Zora, PGN, and Mode, developers who build on one OP Chain supported by Covalent can also easily expand to other OP Chains, reaching millions of potential users.",
  "contributionDescription": "Covalent has provided seamless access to realtime data for developers, analysts, and applications on the OP Stack. Since November 2021, Covalent has served as a key data infrastructure provider for Optimism, indexing OP Mainnet, OP Sepolia, OP Goerli, four OP Chains (Base, Zora, Public Goods Network, Mode), and six OP Stack Forks (opBNB, Mantle, Metis, Boba, Kinto, Loot Chain).\n\nOur Unified API provides transparency and visibility into assets across all supported OP Stack chains, while Increment serves as a BI Tool, enabling visualization of data and the extraction of valuable insights.\n\nThis allows developers and analysts to save time and resources and lets them focus on building applications and conducting analyses without worrying about the complexities of onchain data infrastructure.",
