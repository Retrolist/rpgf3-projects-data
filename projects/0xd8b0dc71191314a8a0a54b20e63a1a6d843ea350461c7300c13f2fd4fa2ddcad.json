  "impactDescription": "- Rainbow's multi-network UI and native L2 token and NFT support improved UX for OP users, which, only recently, became the industry standard.\n- Rainbow has evangelized Optimism to users and creators, helping drive a 295% increase in Rainbow Wallet interactions with OP Stack chains since July\n- Today, 34% of Rainbow's connections, 40% of RainbowRouter\u2019s USD volume and 70% of bridges are to OP stack chains. \n- 28% of distinct Rainbow users transact on OP stack chains (+62% since January), surpassing the proportion of users on mainnet - 18.6%. \n- \u201cRainbow World,\u201d Rainbow\u2019s contribution to \u201cOnchain summer,\u201d was minted 10k+ times, remains the 2nd highest traded NFT on Base, continues to drive onchain actions via the character creator and brought new cool users to OP Collective's NFT scene",
  "contributionDescription": "The wallet user experience for interacting with Layer 2s was a major hinderance to their adoption. By default, wallets only supported mainnet or required users to manually add an RPC to interact with L2s. Wallet balances were siloed by network, causing friction when using multiple chains and leading many users to perceive their OP assets as secondary to their assets on mainnet.\n\nSince 2021, Rainbow Wallet has prioritized its support for L2 networks and introduced new design patterns that dramatically improved their usability. Rainbow was first to offer native L2 support (without having to manually add RPCs), implement frictionless in-app swapping and bridging between networks, and establish a multinetwork UI that consolidates mainnet and L2 assets - now the UX standard for many wallets.",
