  "contributionDescription": "Let me be clear: I've done absolutely nothing worth a retroactive reward. \n\nZilch, nada, zero.\n\nWhy am I here? The story begins with a strange man called binji.\n\nI was minding my own onchain business, trying to use Defisaver for flashloan arbitrage. Ask about that topic in their Discord, they love it. \n\nSuddenly, a black smoke screen filled the room. I could not see anymore. But I could smell the distinctive scent of phoenix ashes mixed baby tears. This could mean only one thing: after all these years, binji caught up with me.\n\n\"Sign up for PGF3!\" he said. \"or else...\"\n\n\"Or else what?\" I asked.\n\nBut he was gone just as fast as he appeared. Still, despite his departure a sense of impending doom lingered. One does not defy the Optimism Collective. I had to comply with his demands.",
