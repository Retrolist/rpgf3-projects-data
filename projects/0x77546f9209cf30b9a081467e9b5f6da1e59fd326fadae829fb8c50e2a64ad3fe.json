  "impactDescription": "With my content I have educated users and thereby created turst/credibility. Furthermore, I have inspired new users to join the Collective. By familiarizing people with the technology & educating them about the trust assumptions that underly the networks, I contributed to growing the community, as is evidenced by the significant reach of my posts/threads (see google sheet linked below).\n\nAdditionally, my more technical content is empowering builders to design highly customized app-specific rollups on the OP-Stack & piece together the ideal network configs for their specific use cases, also through RaaS like Caldera. By educating builders about the advantages of modular execution layers, I help to grow the OP Stack's ecosystem of builders and subsequently chains in the Superchain vision.",
  "contributionDescription": "As a researcher & content creator with a strong focus on rollups, modular scaling and zk tech, I have published a lot of educational resources to educate people on how rollups work, why they matter and what the benefits, drawbacks, differences & underlying trust assumptions of these systems are. \n\nWhile a lot of my content is aimed at a rather broad audience of users that can range from non-technical to tech-savvy, I also create more in-depth / technical content on modular blockchain architecture & zk tech. This kind of content, is slightly more geared towards a technical audience including builders and devs. The goal is to empower them to build out customized & optimized execution layers on top of Ethereum's battle-tested security guarantees that are more performant and secure.\n",
