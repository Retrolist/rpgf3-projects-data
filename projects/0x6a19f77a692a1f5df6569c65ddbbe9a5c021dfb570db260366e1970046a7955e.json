And there is a lot to celebrate: by our estimation, over the past two years, OP Mainnet has cumulatively saved users $2.69 billion in fees, 15.8 years of waiting for transaction confirmations, and currently secures $2.8 billion in onchain value.\n\nBut the reality is: nobody has truly scaled Ethereum. That includes us.\n\nIf Ethereum is to rival the goliaths of web2, and take software\u2019s next bite of the world, it needs internet-level scale. No single chain today can offer that.",
