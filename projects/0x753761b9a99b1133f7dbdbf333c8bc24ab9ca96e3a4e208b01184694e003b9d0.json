  "impactDescription": "On the Geo Web, we've pushed the envelope both technically & how public goods can outcompete proprietary solutions. We've contributed intangible benefits to Optimism not just being a chain of forks and rinse/repeat playbooks. We\u2019ve stretched users beyond simple NFT mints with our PCO digital land market & demonstrated how sustainable market mechanisms can compound value by funding public goods.\n\nWe\u2019ve drawn new application builders to the OP ecosystem through our first community QF round & provided seed funding for them to make their own impact. \n\nOur open-source Kubernetes Helm charts support the practical realization of the Superchain thesis. Our Swift-MUD client brings onchain gaming & native app functionality to the world\u2019s most valuable consumer user base (Apple app ecosystem).",
  "contributionDescription": "Our ambitious vision for open spatial computing has driven us to impact Optimism even if our vision isn\u2019t fully realized yet. We\u2019ve demonstrated new open-source smart contracts that incorporate innovative web3 concepts like partial common ownership & token streaming.\n\nWe ran the first-ever community QF round on the Gitcoin Grants Stack (4 ETH matching, >$1k direct donations). We helped identify & troubleshoot UX+technical issues, shared lessons learned, & inspired others to run QF rounds on Optimism.\n\nOur work to deliver the onchain AR publishing capabilities has yielded two general-use open-source libraries: Kubernetes Helm charts for easier OP Chain deployment management & a native SWIFT-MUD client to bring more onchain functionality/Autonomous Worlds to the Apple app ecosystem.",
