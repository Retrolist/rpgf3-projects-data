  "impactDescription": "We have been live since May 2023 and due to our growth we will discuss metrics for the last quarter, starting Aug 15 '23 to Oct 23 '23.\nOur app had 1.4k unique visitors and sent out 1.1k job applications for 315 unique applicants.\nOur non-technical telegram channel, accounting for half of our users, has grown to \u00b12.5k subscribers, but as we don\u2019t have detailed analytics on applicants there we have to assume that the applicant stats are similar, thus doubling our impact in the last quarter to \u00b12200 applications across \u00b1600 applicants.\nWe confirmed hires, and never took funds from protocols for this.\nWe deployed a backend to our staging env, allowing us to add any organization that we could not previously support, bringing us closer to our goal of indexing every organization in the space.",
  "contributionDescription": "In September 2021, we identified a fragmented Crypto Job landscape, with many sites charging for postings, thus sidelining smaller protocols. In May 2022, our self-funded team unveiled JobStash, a platform for publishing jobs for both emerging and established protocols. We index vacancies from organization career pages, thus eliminating scams and the need for their direct involvement, and do not require financial contributions to list jobs.\n\nWe index  >4K jobs from 224 organizations deploying on 50+ chains. \n14 of these organizations deploy on Optimism.\nWe publish to >5k TG subs daily.\n\nUsing AI, we structure job details and add in both manually-researched data, like organizational headcounts, and auto-imported data, such as funding specifics, protocol financials, audits and hacks.",
