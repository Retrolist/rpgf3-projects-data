  "impactDescription": "This open-source public good enabled the Moonwell community to expand to the Base L2 and reach over 2,000 new OP stack users, while maintaining our community's high standards for decentralization and trust minimization. \n\nThe Moonwell protocol was successfully activated on Base mainnet August 9th through a cross-chain governance proposal, and since then, our community has successfully passed 7 additional cross-chain proposals.\n\nMoonwell has consistently been in the top 10 TVL projects on Base as measured by DeFi Llama since launch on August 9th.",
  "contributionDescription": "Temporal Governance is a groundbreaking approach to cross-chain protocol governance that provides unique benefits to communities that adopt the Optimism Superchain and deploy to multiple OP Stack networks.\n\nThis public good consists of open source Solidity and JavaScript code that enables any online community to govern smart contracts deployed to multiple Ethereum networks. It not only enables cross-chain governance, it also enables developers to fully automate the scheduling and execution of cross-chain proposals once they have been voted on.\n\nUnderpinning its reliability, Temporal Governance has undergone rigorous scrutiny, passing two comprehensive security audits from Halborn Security and Code4rena.\n\nThe Moonwell community has grown by over 2,000 active users on Base by adopting it.",
