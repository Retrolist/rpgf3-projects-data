  "impactDescription": "- The Rainbow Road has enabled users to migrate Arc tokens to and from Base and Optimism.\n\n- Worked with team at Chainlink to open lanes between Base and Optimism for the Rainbow Road as well as other chains supported by Chainlink's CCIP and Archly.\n\n- Enabled the ability to bring products and services from remote chains to Optimism and Base, such as Chainlink's Automation.",
  "contributionDescription": "We built the Rainbow Road that allows for resources/data to be exchanged between chains in a fully permissionless and decentralized way. The Rainbow Road does this by abstracting away the needed integration with message passing protocols/services such as Chainlink CCIP, Axelar GMP, and LayerZero to provide a reliable, robust, and scalable platform to accomplish tasks across any chain.  This enables projects and users to:\n\n- Transfer tokens to and from chains, like Base and Optimism\n- Leverage services like Chainlink's Automation, VRF, Data Feeds on any chain\n- Execute actions on remote chains\n\nBy lowering the barrier to go and operate cross-chain through the reduction of development costs, any project can bring their token(s) to Base or Optimism growing their community.",
