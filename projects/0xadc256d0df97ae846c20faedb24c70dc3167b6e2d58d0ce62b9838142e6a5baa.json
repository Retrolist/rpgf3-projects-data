  "impactDescription": "Many people like to write code, some like trade, someone like use products, I love to criticize and look for weaknesses in others' proposals. With me, spending money will be more meaningful and logical. At a minimum, I would like to create a system for screening out all bots and scripts, and introduce a system for receiving drops only for real humans.",
  "contributionDescription": "Since childhood I want to govern some state or project. But I saw many vulnerabilities and imperfections in democracy, monarchy or communism. Now We are DAO, and I believe it can work. I can read proposals, thing and decide what which decision gives to community maximum impact. I can meticulously read suspicious proposals and identify scams. I believe in  DAO and believe that this is the best form of management.",
