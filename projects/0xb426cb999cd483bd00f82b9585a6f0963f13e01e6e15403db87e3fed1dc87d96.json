  "impactDescription": "The Mechanism Library enhances understanding of how mechanisms can solve problems critical to OP Collective, such as governance, public goods funding, and value capture. It also promotes OP-specific case studies: the dual-house governance sytem, attestation station, and airdrop.\n\nThe Mechanism Impact Measurement tool has empowered enabled Gitcoin (OP Stack user) to make data-driven decisions in designing their staking mechanics. This example that can be utilized by other OP Stack users & by Optimism itself.\n\nThe Mechanism Canvas & Seminars fill an educational gap, fostering better-informed development & design choices by mechanism designers.\n\n\"Slashing Engine\" & \"Smart Treaties\" can inspire innovations that drive utility of OP based tools & communities, starting with Gitcoin & Zuzalu.",
  "contributionDescription": "Mechanism Library: Extensive catalogue of coordination mechanims & case studies (including OP mechanisms) that serves as a go-to hub for a diverse audience.\n\nMechanism Impact Measurement: Forkable workbook to model ROI of mechanisms, including cost of capital & demand forecasting. Employed by Gitcoin (OP Stack user) to model staking mechanisms.\n\nMechanism Canvas: Visual template for designing systems in a way that ensures shared understanding of system architecture & goals.\n\n7 seminars (online & IRL) teaching tools & practical strategies for designing better mechanism design.\n\nOpen Source Primitives:\nSlashing Engine to solve sybil attacks in Gitcoin Passport & other claim verification problems\nSmart Treaties to enable Zuzalu & other communities to scale through bilateral staking commitment",
