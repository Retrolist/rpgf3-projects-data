Students keep these account-bound NFTs forever (C).\nWe\u2019ve launched a new course in Sept 2023 specifically on Optimism NFTs & \u201cNFT-based Reputation in Web3\u201d (D).\nTE Academy brings diversity to the Optimism Collective by facilitating 46 peer-2-peer study groups across 14 languages (E).\nOur #TEWeeklyReads newsletter shares the most relevant token engineering developments with 5K+ subscribers with an 40% open rate, and features Optimism in every edition (F).\nOptimism ambassador Fuji AR\u2019s TE Academy feature was also awarded first place by the Optimism community (G).",
  "contributionDescription": "Token Engineering (TE) is a new crypto-native discipline combining computer science, economics, game theory, data science, and more. It is relevant for any protocol or DApp aiming for a successful token network. In this early stage of the field, it\u2019s a problem for projects to find the right experts, and it\u2019s challenging for token engineers to acquire and prove expertise. \nSince October 2022, TE Academy has built a comprehensive study program for aspiring token engineers available as a public good, and brought TE to major crypto events. Today, more than 3000 students are building their professional careers with NFT proofs on Optimism. For the first time in history, we are witnessing the emergence of a new engineering discipline on-chain - on the OP Mainnet!",
