Hi Optimism \ud83d\udc4b.\n\nIn Aug 2021, amidst a need for strong memes and clear comprehension of ETH's evolving economics, Ultra Sound Money, built by two people with no external funding, emerged to fill this void. We share quality ETH info, which educates, excites, and spreads. Screenshots and memes of ours are found all over twitter, every crypto publication, and recently even fidelity's investment thesis. Understanding ETHs strengths is crucial to attract users and projects which feel at home on top. Top meme tweets hit 300K impressions, we have 44.8K followers with 6K \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a users spreading the meme. Our site, an educational hub, averages 260K monthly visitors (peak 499K).",
