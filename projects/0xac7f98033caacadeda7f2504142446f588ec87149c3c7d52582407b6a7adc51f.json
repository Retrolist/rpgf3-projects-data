  "impactDescription": "I am an active holder of Velodrome and part of their governance system. I've minted a few NFTs on optimism and in love with what Optimism and every project in the ecosystem is building. I also have a community of over 10,000 people who are adopting this ecosystem in mass. This can spike the ecosystem's adoption rate.",
  "contributionDescription": "I'm looking forward to building projects on the optimism ecosystem. As an upcoming smart contract developer, I need RetroPGF to acquire more gadgets that enables me to build and grow effectively and efficiently. This can give me the push I need as an individual developer meditating on several creative ideas and see how I can bring this huge vision to light on the Optimism ecosystem. My goal is to find a problem, create a team, bring a long lasting and scaling solution to the problem and build a business around it. This is the \n main reason why I wish to receive RetroPGF for.",
