  "impactDescription": "- moving capital from major multichain projects to OpenX which is a small Optimism dedicated project, both for the vaults as for the (ve)NFT market. \n- creating a decentral liquid wrapper for veVelo which allows especially major MarketCap or Ecosystem project to effectively build a base APR rate on velodrome.",
  "contributionDescription": "contribution for Smerdyakov from OpenX team. Trough his thinking the OpenX team delivered cool OP native products. OpenX is a small team committed to Optimism, making public decentralized goods there. top products;\n\n- (ve)NFT market; dedicated interface for veNFT trading moving traffic from OpenSea to OpenX (OP Native) Unique innovations: 1) trade in any NFT for any ERC token, 2) displaying discount %'s of veNFT vs market rate, 3) only 1% trading fee, only to cover bare cost\n\n- opxvelo is now a decentralized liquid wrapper of vevelo where the voting power is committed to those who LP with it (1opxvelo in LP = 1 vevelo vote). This makes it effective a decentralized liquid wrapper, and allows ecosystem projects to get a certain baseline of APR without bribing and regardless of TVL in LP.\n\n\n\n",
