  "impactDescription": "I am a content creator with a large audience on twitter. One of my best contributions that has greatly impacted my native Iranian community is my full airdrop strategy. I received very positive feedback from the community, as it helped them easily engage with various platforms and enhance their interactions. I have consistently created various types of content, covering news and events related to the Optimism and Opstack ecosystems. I have successfully onboarded numerous users and encouraged them to engage with the platforms. Moreover, I have been instrumental in motivating users to delegate their OP holdings and actively contribute to OP governance.",
