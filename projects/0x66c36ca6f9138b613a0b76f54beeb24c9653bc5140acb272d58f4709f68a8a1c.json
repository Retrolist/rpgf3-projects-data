  "impactDescription": "We\u2019re not limited to Ethereum; L2s like OP are an integral part of the Ethereum ecosystem as well. All our content intends to appeal the collective, because it is aimed at devs and security researchers that may belong to the collective, who are interested in securing Optimism-based apps.\n\nIn the past we've examined OP\u2019s bridge security measures, showing differences with Arbitrum in strategies to prevent gas grieving attacks. And reported a relevant security issue in a public security contest.\n\nThanks to the 2-day conference \u201cGEERS: Blockchain edition\u201d we hosted in Argentina, over 250 people from various cities learned about OP for the first time. The topic was featured at least twice in the talks. Particularly in a talk by Joxes on \"The Importance of Participatory Roles in Governance\".",
  "contributionDescription": "We\u2019re an autonomous collective helping enhance the security of the Ethereum ecosystem and those who contribute to its long-term success. We\u2019ve taken a public-good approach to security research, putting our skills in favor of the community. So far funded by grants from the Ethereum Foundation, we conducted security reviews, responsibly disclosed vulnerabilities, and produced free educational material in articles, interviews, videos, talks, workshops and challenges. We engaged with LATAM communities, sponsoring meetups and hosting events for web3 devs and security researchers. Our work wasn\u2019t exclusive to the Optimism Collective, yet it contributed to educating security researchers and developers on security topics that are relevant for Optimism-based applications to stay safe.",
