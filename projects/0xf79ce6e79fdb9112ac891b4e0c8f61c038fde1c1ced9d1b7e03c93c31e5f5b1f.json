  "impactDescription": "It's difficult to gauge my impact on the collectives, I can share the feedback I have received from collective members for my contribution, and the number of comments on Discord or posts on different online platforms but I don't want this to turn into a selling pitch. \n\nIdeally, a positive contribution should speak for itself so I would like to try another approach. Existing collective members involved in governance might be able to judge my contribution, to new badge holders, I would request them to gauge my impact if they have read, seen and felt my contribution towards SuperChain in any form either on the Forum/Reddit/Farcaster or on Twitter. \n\n",
  "contributionDescription": "As an active Optimism collective member since day 1, my commitment is evident through my Delegate Thread and forum profile. With over 700 posts created and 14,000 posts read, I've played a substantial role in facilitating discussions.\n\nIn the initial governance phase, I provided proposal feedback, even during Phase 0. Beyond the forum, I supported Optimism Governance and the Optimism Superchain, creating content and raising awareness online (reddit/farcaster/X)\n\nI initiated discussions on Governance Fund Accountability and voter apathy in Governance on the forum.\n\nThis could be related to RPGF's Developer Ecosystem, I encouraged Locksmith Wallet to submit grant requests, onboarding them to OP chain.\n\nNote: I served on the grant council in season 2 and received 7174 OP ",
