  "impactDescription": "The Dune dashboards that I created about Gitcoin Passport, EAS, SushiSwap, and Iron Bank in Optimism helped analysts, developers and other stakeholders in the Collective to identify areas for product growth and track the performance.\n\nOn the other hand, Influenpeer enabled the creation of video NFTs up to 10 GB with video playback optimised for all the bandwidths with Livepeer on top of onchain rewards. Creators and their audience in the OP stack were able to build a rich creator economy in the Superchain. Influenpeer also welcomed other developers to build a similar experience and extend it with other features and plugins.\n\nGenNFT Forge empowered consumers and the university student community to create and sell easily generative NFTs driving demand to onchain rewards in the Superchain.\n",
  "contributionDescription": "As an enthusiastic supporter of the OP Stack and the Optimism Collective my contributions over the past months have been the following: \n(1) Created a Dune dashboard on Gitcoin Passport and the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) in Optimism. \n(2) Created a Dune dashboard about the contribution of SushiSwap to the growth of the Optimism user base.\n(3) Created a Dune dashboard on Iron Bank Liquidity Mining in Optimism.\n(4) Developed Influenpeer which is a platform to create video NFTs up to 10 GB  and enable the generation of onchain rewards in the Superchain.\n(5) Developed GenNFT Forge to create generative AI NFTs and enable the generation of onchain rewards in the Superchain.",
