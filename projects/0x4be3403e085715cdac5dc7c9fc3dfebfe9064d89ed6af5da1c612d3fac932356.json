  "impactDescription": "Joined EPF, noticed Optimism's lead in ERC4337 adaptation across chains. Proposed a universal eth_sendRawTransactionConditional() method for mainnet & Layer 2 solutions.\nPost writing code flow articles, received recognition from advanced users including Opensea's vase. Discord mods often cite my articles for complex queries. Assisted curious developers.\nResolved a long-standing bundler issue in the Optimism repo, creating a tool easing future ERC4337 tests on Optimism devnet.\nActively addressing open issues in the Optimism repo, engaging in discussions with Proto.\nAssisted with developer inquiries and ecosystem products, earning unanimous acclaim.",
  "contributionDescription": "Hi Optimism fans, I'm Joohhnnn, a big fan of Optimism just like you. I've been a developer for three years and have submitted some PRs to Geth, the Ethereum ecosystem, and op-node. I'm also part of EPF4 (Eth-Protocol-Fellows), and am working on the project \"Optimism-Sequencer-Support-for-ERC-4337-Bundlers\". Plus, I've written many articles for developers to explain how Optimism works. Additionally, I've created a tool to adapt Optimism's devnet and bundler, enhancing the workflow for developers.",
